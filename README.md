### More About My Interests

#### Software Development

Software development is a vast field with endless possibilities. Over the years, I have worked on various projects that span different domains. From developing mobile applications that assist users in their daily tasks to creating robust backend systems for web applications, my experience is diverse. I am proficient in several programming languages including Python, Java, and C#. I also have experience with frameworks like React, Django, and Node.js.

One of my notable projects involved creating a mobile app that helps users manage their personal finances. The app integrates with users' bank accounts, categorizes transactions, and provides insightful analytics to help them make informed financial decisions. This project was a significant learning experience for me, as it involved working with APIs, managing data security, and ensuring a smooth user experience.

#### Artificial Intelligence

The potential of AI to transform industries and improve lives is immense. During my studies, I have focused extensively on machine learning and deep learning. I have worked on projects that involve training neural networks for image recognition, natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis, and developing recommendation systems.

One project I am particularly proud of is a chatbot I developed for a university project. The chatbot uses natural language processing to understand and respond to user queries. It was designed to assist students with common questions about university services, course details, and campus events. This project not only enhanced my understanding of AI but also taught me the importance of user-centered design.
